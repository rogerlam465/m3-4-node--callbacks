# Module 3: Node - Day 4

This workshop is kept purposefully small, but it will still require some work, but no coding...

I have provided you with a working todo list app.

## Setup

You can setup and run the app with the following commands.

```
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Try out the app, but **don't yet look too closely at the code**. There will be time enough for that in a bit.
